This folder includes the code that was used to test the REINFORCE-based methods on the experimental data. 
- reinforce_gillespie_pytorch provides the implementation of REINFORCE and REINFORCE with baseline. 
- modified_reinforce provides the implementation for RLOO

This folder also includes the experimental data files provided by Jones et al.

The two files called 5DL1_dga and lacUD5_dga are included for completeness, but they are the code provided by Rijal et al. in their Differentiable Gillespie Algorithm paper.
